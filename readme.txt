== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the Blue Hat Turbo plugin and what does it do? =

In short, it is a turbo charging plugin that speeds up your website by offering various industry leading optimization techniques like advanced loss-less image compression, JavaScript/CSS/HTML compression, parallel download optimization, and pre-fetch DNS optimization. It is a quick, easy plugin that anyone can use to instantly supercharge their website with the click of a button. It also allows you to offload your website's static media files to your preferred Cloud Delivery Network for ultimate low-latency delivery of your optimized files.

= How much does the Blue Hat Turbo plugin cost? =

The Blue Hat Turbo plugin is completely FREE and licensed under GNU opensource license, so you are welcome to download it and start using it by visiting [BlueHatNetwork.com](http://www.BlueHatNetwork.com) or you can simply install it thru your /wp-admin/ section of your website. You can use the Blue Hat Turbo plugin with our Blue Hat Cloud Delivery Network, or you can use it with any of our major competitors like Amazon CloudFront, or Rackspace Cloudfiles, because it has built-in support for various cloud networks, so that you can easily compare the performance differences between networks if you wanted to.

= Quickly tell me how Blue Hat Turbo plugin turbo charges my website? =

The Blue Hat Turbo plugin turbo charges your website by using various industry leading optimization techniques which you could not easily accomplish on your own, like advanced loss-less image/JavaScript/CSS/HTML compression, and parallel download optimization. These are just some of the features and benefits the Blue Hat Turbo plugin offers aside from being able to offload all your static media files to a low-latency CDN of your choice.

= What optimization features does Blue Hat Turbo plugin offer exactly? =

It offers various industry leading optimization techniques, like pre-fetch DNS optimization, advanced loss-less image/JavaScript/CSS/HTML compression, parallel download optimization, database optimization, and the ability to offload your static media files to a CDN of your choice.

= What CDNs or Cloud Networks does the Blue Hat Turbo plugin support? =

The Blue Hat Turbo plugin not only supports our own cloud delivery network, but it also supports some of our major competitors networks too, like Amazon Cloudfront and Rackspace Cloudfiles, so that way you can compare which CDN works better for you, all from one plugin. You can choose your preferred CDN from the settings tab on the main control panel page of the Blue Hat Turbo plugin.

= Can I use Blue Hat Turbo plugin with Amazon CloudFront? =

Yes, absolutely, the Blue Hat Turbo plugin not only supports our own cloud delivery network, but it also supports our major competitors too, like Amazon Cloudfront and Rackspace Cloudfiles, so that you can easily compare which CDN works better for you, all from one plugin. You can choose your preferred CDN from the settings tab on the main control panel page of the Blue Hat Turbo plugin.

= Can I use Blue Hat Turbo plugin with Rackspace Cloudfiles? =

Yes, absolutely, the Blue Hat Turbo plugin not only supports our own cloud delivery network, but it also supports our major competitors too, like Amazon Cloudfront and Rackspace Cloudfiles, so that you can easily compare which CDN works better for you, all from one plugin. You can choose your preferred CDN from the settings tab on the main control panel page of the Blue Hat Turbo plugin.

= Why should I choose to use Blue Hat CDN with the Blue Hat Turbo plugin as opposed to using it with Amazon CloudFront or Rackspace Cloudfiles? =

Well, one of the main reasons is, the Blue Hat Content Delivery Network offers a more advanced form of gzip compression to compress and deliver your files to your visitors even faster than other networks or other forms of compression. Our advanced method of gzip compression goes beyond what other standard gzip compressors do. None of the other networks like Amazon CloudFront or Rackspace Cloudfiles offer this right now, they only offer standard gzip compression, which is good, but it's not the ultimate compression tool to get the smallest and fastest delivery of your files that you can possibly get, so that is where the Blue Hat Delivery network comes into play but another one of the reasons is, our network is custom built and specialized to deliver ONLY Javascript, CSS, and image files whereas other cloud networks are optimized for a more general purpose which allows us to use certain optimization techniques that they cannot due to the fact that we target those specific file types only. For this reason, our cloud network outperforms most major competitors in delivering these type of files.

= Can I not use the CDN offloading feature of the plugin and just use the other optimization features? =

Yes, absolutely, you can toggle any of the features Blue Hat Turbo plugin offers by visiting the settings tab of the Blue Hat Turbo plugin on the main control panel page located in your /wp-admin/ after installing the plugin.

= Is there any documentation or helpful guides and tutorials? =

Yes there are helpful tutorials, videos, and documentation available for Blue Hat Turbo plugin [on our website, BlueHatNetwork.com](http://www.BlueHatNetwork.com/).

= 2.9.3 =
* Fixed issue with load-scripts.php and load-styles.php expansion function to include dependencies for WordPress users.
* Fixed issue with vertical scrollbar not displaying on exclude file/folder list.
* Added fail safe check to ensure main plugin file is not called more than once to avoid PHP fatal error on WordPress.

= 2.9.2 =
* Drastically improved sync performance for Amazon Cloudfront and Rackspace Cloudfiles users by removing Yahoo Smush.it service, JShrink, and CSSMin, and replacing them with our own in-house file optimization API.
* Slightly optimized BlueHatNetworkFactory::getSyncModel() function by replacing the if statement with a PHP switch statement instead.
* Fixed issue with JShrink not properly optimizing certain edge-case javascript files, by completely removing JShrink and replacing it with our own in-house file optimization API.
* Fixed issue with the plugin reporting invalid API credentials error message when switching between CDNs on first attempt.

= 2.9.1 =
* Added new URL variable to ignore for offloading and optimizing files feature for WordPress users. Thx to Phil (ugavetduddz) for reporting this issue!
* Fixed issue with action URLs being optimized. Thx to Jason L. for reporting this issue and patiently working with our engineers to resolve the issue.

= 2.9 =
* Improved performance slightly by removing preg_quote on strings that can be pre-determined.
* Fix for externalize inline snippets function to exclude email masquerading snippets.

= 2.8 =
* Changed JS Optimization Library for Amazon and Rackspace CDN users only from JSMin to JShrink because the JSMin is no longer maintained by its developers.
* Updated CSSMin for Amazon and Rackspace CDN users only to the latest version for latest bug fixes and improvements.
* Fixed PHP warning "Warning: curl_setopt() [function.curl-setopt]: CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION cannot be activated when safe_mode is enabled or an open_basedir is set" when safe mode or open_base_dir is on, thx to our users Tim H., and Stathis K. for reporting the issue.
* Added exclusion for email masquerading JavaScript snippet to prevent it from being externalized repeatedly since email masquerading snippets change per each request.
* Removed reset Blue Hat Turbo index data upon install or reinstall plugin since it is no longer crucial to reset the index data upon installation or re-installation.

= 2.7 =
* Fixed very tiny but critical bug which could leave a page render-less if it has inline javascript that is not properly terminated with a semi-colon.

= 2.6 =
* Made the <i>Safely Clear Index Data</i> button in the admin panel work even if it can't load bhn.js.
* Removed the PHP <i>allow_url_fopen</i> requirement and switched to PHP cURL instead for all POST and GET requests.
* Moved the <i>Combine JavaScript/CSS files</i> feature to execute after the <i>Externalize JavaScript/CSS files</i> feature to allow it to combine the page further by combining your inline JavaScript/CSS with your other external JavaScript/CSS files.
* Made sync process much much faster by allowing our CDN and software to upload multiple files at a time.
* Removed Yahoo! Smush.it for Blue Hat CDN users since Yahoo Smush.it is a bit outdated, slow, over rated, and unreliable. Blue Hat CDN users now get the benefit of using our own advanced, custom, dedicated, and more importantly, modern, loss-less image optimization service which actually optimizes and compresses better than Yahoo's Smush.it service since it uses more modern optimization technology.
* Removed Google Closure Compiler since it is too slow to be practical for on-the-fly optimization service. The few extra bytes it MIGHT save is not worth the long wait. We are now using Yahoo's YUI Compressor instead since their library is much faster and more mature than Google's.

= 2.5 =
* Fixed issue with MeshHash compiler failing to compile if remote files are gzipped.

= 2.4 =
* Fixed small but urgent bug with certain css files not being included in the sync process if they begin with an @ symbol.

* Changed HTML optimizer to limit the characters per line to 1000 characters for smoother parsing on web browsers.
* Made numerous text corrections and additions.
* Increased compatibility with WordPress multi-site installations to only scan and sync files related to that child site.
